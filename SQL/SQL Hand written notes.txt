SQL Notes
----------- Class 1 ----------
SQL: Structured Query Language, used to interact with DB. 

eg: librarian -> ask for book (query), updata detail (updata), add a new book (insert), remove the book(delete).

Why SQL?
	- almot every app/website uses a db.
	- industy-standard (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)
	- sql makes it easy to store, retrive, and mange the data.
	
Real example: 
	Instagram: post, likes, comments
	E-Commerse: products, orders, customers.

SQL vs NoSQL
SQL: data in structured form. Rows and column format
	features:
		- schema-based: data structure must be defined befor inseting data.
		- sql (select, inset, updata.....)
		- relationship b/w tables using Primary Key & Foreign Key
	
	Advantages: 
		- Best for Structured Data.
		- complex queries supported with joins
		- Strong consistency & reliability(ACID)
	
	Disadvantages: 
		- Rigid: schema must be predefined
		- Scaling is harder
	
	Real examples:
		- banking system
		- college/universities
		- e-commerse orders
	

NoSQL: Data stored are flexible, cna store unstructured, semi-structured.
	features:
		- schema-less (no fix structure)
		- diff types:
			- Key-Value (Redis)
			- document base (MongoDB -> json like)
			- column-based(cassandra)
		- desinge for scaliblity(Horizontal)
	
	Advantages: 
		- flexible
		- scales easily with large distributed data.
		- Faste for big data and real time apps.
	
	Disadvantages:
		- less strict
		- limited complex queries (joins not support)
		
	real examples:
		- social media
		- e-commerse
		- real time app:
